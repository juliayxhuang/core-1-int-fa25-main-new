       <p>What sets Chahalo apart is their standout offerings like the Black Milk Tea Frappé with the signature “snow-cap” of creamy foam—an item highlighted during their grand opening in Chinatown. This menu also includes more traditional milk teas, fruit teas, and specialty drinks served in the trendy “boba” format. For locals and visitors alike, it’s a refreshing stop that balances nostalgia for classic Taiwanese tea houses with a sleek, urban edge. It makes for a perfect pause between dim-sum binges or while wandering the colorful streets of Chinatown.</p>
